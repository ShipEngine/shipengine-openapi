    "description": "ShipEngine is the world's best multi-carrier shipping API, with more than 20 supported shipping carriers.  You can easily get and compare shipping rates, print labels, track your shipments, and validate addresses anywhere in the world.\n\n### Worldwide Major Carrier Support\nAccess the top global carriers in minutes—instead of weeks. Simply [connect your existing carrier accounts](https://docs.shipengine.com/docs/setup-a-carrier) in the API dashboard, and then [begin creating labels](https://docs.shipengine.com/docs/use-a-specific-service).\n\n### Real-Time Tracking\n[Track packages](https://docs.shipengine.com/docs/track-a-package) across any of our 20+ supported carrier accounts and create tracking events to keep your customers up-to-date. Easily integrate real-time tracking information for shipments into your app, email, or SMS.\n\n### Get Rates Across Carriers\nMake sure you ship as cost-effectively as possible by [quickly comparing rates](https://docs.shipengine.com/docs/get-shipping-rates) using the ShipEngine Rates API. As long as you have the carrier connected to your account, you'll be able to see and compare different rates and services.\n\n### Global Address Validation\nNo matter your shipping volume, failed deliveries and address change surcharges cut into your bottom line and damage perception with customers. Our address validation services ensure your packages make it to the right place the first time. [Learn how to leverage our address validation services here.](https://docs.shipengine.com/docs/address-validation)\n\nShipEngine supports address validation for over 180 countries, including the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Australia, Germany, France, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Israel, Italy, and more.\n"

Any number of API keys can be generated within the ShipEngine dashboard and are unique to your account. Your API keys give full access to ShipEngine's functionality and therefore should be guarded in the same way you would guard a password or other application credentials. Once you have generated an API key you simply add it to your request as an HTTP header named the api-key.\n\nFind your ShipEngine API keys in the Dashboard: https://app.shipengine.com/#/portal/apimanagement\n"
