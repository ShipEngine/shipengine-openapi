    ShipEngine is the world's best multi-carrier shipping API, with more than 20 supported shipping carriers.  You can easily get and compare shipping rates, print labels, track your shipments, and validate addresses anywhere in the world.

    ### Worldwide Major Carrier Support
    Access the top global carriers in minutes—instead of weeks. Simply [connect your existing carrier accounts](https://docs.shipengine.com/docs/setup-a-carrier) in the API dashboard, and then [begin creating labels](https://docs.shipengine.com/docs/use-a-specific-service).

    ### Real-Time Tracking
    [Track packages](https://docs.shipengine.com/docs/track-a-package) across any of our 20+ supported carrier accounts and create tracking events to keep your customers up-to-date. Easily integrate real-time tracking information for shipments into your app, email, or SMS.

    ### Get Rates Across Carriers
    Make sure you ship as cost-effectively as possible by [quickly comparing rates](https://docs.shipengine.com/docs/get-shipping-rates) using the ShipEngine Rates API. As long as you have the carrier connected to your account, you'll be able to see and compare different rates and services.

    ### Global Address Validation
    No matter your shipping volume, failed deliveries and address change surcharges cut into your bottom line and damage perception with customers. Our address validation services ensure your packages make it to the right place the first time. [Learn how to leverage our address validation services here.](https://docs.shipengine.com/docs/address-validation)

    ShipEngine supports address validation for over 180 countries, including the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Australia, Germany, France, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Israel, Italy, and more.

      Shipments are at the center of the ShipEngine API.  A shipment is the first step in [creating a shipping label](https://docs.shipengine.com/docs/quickstart-create-a-label), or [creating a manifest](https://docs.shipengine.com/docs/understand-and-create-manifests).  It's also essential for [getting shipping rates](https://docs.shipengine.com/docs/get-shipping-rates).

      [Webhooks](https://docs.shipengine.com/docs/setting-up-web-hooks) are a powerful feature of ShipEngine that can save you from sending repeated polling requests to check on the state of something.  With webhooks, ShipEngine will automatically contact your servers when the stage changes.  This can include [parcel tracking](https://docs.shipengine.com/docs/track-a-package) events, notification of the completion of a [batch operation](https://docs.shipengine.com/docs/using-batches),  or new [salses orders](https://docs.shipengine.com/docs/sales-orders-getting-started).

        The address-recognition API makes it easy for you to extract address data from unstructured text, including the recipient name, line 1, line 2, city, postal code, and more.

        Data often enters your system as unstructured text (for example: emails, SMS messages, support tickets, or other documents). ShipEngine's address-recognition API helps you extract meaningful, structured data from this unstructured text. The parsed address data is returned in the same structure that's used for other ShipEngine APIs, such as address validation, rate quotes, and shipping labels.

        > **Note:** Address recognition is currently supported for the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Ireland.

    summary: Print shipping labels
    description: |
      Print shipping labels for any of the top global carriers in minutes—instead of weeks. Simply [connect your existing carrier accounts](https://docs.shipengine.com/docs/setup-a-carrier) in the API dashboard, and then [begin creating labels](https://docs.shipengine.com/docs/use-a-specific-service).

      summary: List labels
      description: |
        This endpoint returns a list of labels that you've [created](https://docs.shipengine.com/docs/quickstart-create-a-label). You can optionally filter the results as well as control their sort order and the number of results returned at a time.

        By default, all labels are returned, 25 at a time, starting with the most recently created ones.  You can combine multiple filter options to narrow-down the results.  For example, if you only want to get your UPS labels for your east coast warehouse you could query by both `warehouse_id` and `carrier_id`

        > **Warning:** Test labels (those created with `test_label: true`) are not included in the results.  If you've only ever created test labels, then the results will be empty.

      description: |
        The shipment-recognition API makes it easy for you to extract shipping data from unstructured text, including people's names, addresses, package weights and dimensions, insurance and delivery requirements, and more.

        Data often enters your system as unstructured text (for example: emails, SMS messages, support tickets, or other documents). ShipEngine's shipment-recognition API helps you extract meaningful, structured data from this unstructured text. The parsed shipment data is returned in the same structure that's used for other ShipEngine APIs, so you can easily use the parsed data to create a shipping label.

        > **Note:** Shipment recognition is currently supported for the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Ireland.

        All requests to ShipEngine must include an API key in order to be authenticated. Any number of API keys can be generated within the ShipEngine dashboard and are unique to your account. Your API keys give full access to ShipEngine's functionality and therefore should be guarded in the same way you would guard a password or other application credentials. Once you have generated an API key you simply add it to your request as an HTTP header named the api-key.

            The result object is different for each entity type.

            Most entity results have a `value` field, which is the normalized value of the entity.  For example, if the substring "john doe" was recognized as a "person" entity, then the value might be normalized to have proper capitalization (e.g. "John Doe").  Or if the substring "ft worth" was recognized as a "city" entity, then the value might be normalized to "Fort Worth".

            Some entities have other information in addition to, or instead of a `value`.  For example, a "dimensions" entity will have separate fields for `length`, `width`, `height`, and `unit`.
