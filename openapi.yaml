    ShipEngine's easy-to-use REST API lets you manage all of your shipping needs
    without worrying about the complexities of different carrier APIs and
    protocols. We handle all the heavy lifting so you can focus on providing a
    first-class shipping experience for your customers at the best possible
    prices.


    Each of ShipEngine's features can be used by itself or in conjunction with
    each other to build powerful shipping functionality into your application or
    service.


    ## Getting Started

    If you're new to REST APIs then be sure to read our [introduction to
    REST](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/rest/) to understand the basics. 
    Learn how to [authenticate yourself to
    ShipEngine](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/auth/), and then use our
    [sandbox environment](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/sandbox/) to kick the
    tires and get familiar with our API. If you run into any problems, then be
    sure to check the [error handling
    guide](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/errors/) for tips.


    Here are some step-by-step **tutorials** to get you started:

      - [Learn how to create your first shipping label](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/labels/create-a-label/)
      - [Calculate shipping costs and compare rates across carriers](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/rates/)
      - [Track packages on-demand or in real time](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/tracking/)
      - [Validate mailing addresses anywhere on Earth](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/addresses/validation/)


    ## Shipping Labels for Every Major Carrier

    ShipEngine makes it easy to [create shipping labels for any
    carrier](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/labels/create-a-label/) and
    [download them](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/labels/downloading/) in a
    [variety of file formats](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/labels/formats/).
    You can even customize labels with your own
    [messages](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/labels/messages/) and
    [images](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/labels/branding/).



    ## Real-Time Package Tracking

    With ShipEngine you can [get the current status of a
    package](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/tracking/) or [subscribe to
    real-time tracking
    updates](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/tracking/webhooks/) via webhooks.
    You can also create [custimized tracking
    pages](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/tracking/branded-tracking-page/) with
    your own branding so your customers will always know where their package is.



    ## Compare Shipping Costs Across Carriers

    Make sure you ship as cost-effectively as possible by [comparing rates
    across carriers](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/rates/get-shipment-rates/)
    using the ShipEngine Rates API. Or if you don't know the full shipment
    details yet, then you can [get rate
    estimates](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/rates/estimate/) with limited
    address info.



    ## Worldwide Address Validation

    ShipEngine supports [address
    validation](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/addresses/validation/) for
    virtually [every country on
    Earth](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/addresses/validation/countries/),
    including the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Australia, Germany,
    France, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Israel, Italy, and over 160 others.

      Data often enters your system as unstructured text (for example: emails,
      SMS messages, support tickets, or other documents). ShipEngine's
      address-recognition API helps you extract meaningful address data (e.g.
      recipient name, address line 1, line 2, city, postal code) from this
      unstructured text.

        The address-recognition API makes it easy for you to extract address
        data from unstructured text, including the recipient name, line 1, line
        2, city, postal code, and more.


        Data often enters your system as unstructured text (for example: emails,
        SMS messages, support tickets, or other documents). ShipEngine's
        address-recognition API helps you extract meaningful, structured data
        from this unstructured text. The parsed address data is returned in the
        same structure that's used for other ShipEngine APIs, such as address
        validation, rate quotes, and shipping labels.


        > **Note:** Address recognition is currently supported for the United
        States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Ireland.

          and country, and only want to parse the street address into separate
          lines.

      Batches are an advanced feature of ShipEngine designed for users who need
      to generate hundreds or thousands of labels at a time.

      When ShipEngine generates labels it relies on many carriers, their
      services, their dependencies, and a number of other variables

      to fulfill your requests; those requests can take a few minutes for us to
      get back to you.

        This endpoint returns a list of labels that you've

        can optionally filter the results as well as control their sort order
        and the number of results returned at a time.


        By default, all labels are returned, 25 at a time, starting with the
        most recently created ones.  You can combine multiple filter options to
        narrow-down the results.  For example, if you only want to get your UPS
        labels for your east coast warehouse you could query by both
        `warehouse_id` and `carrier_id`

      Many manifests are sent electronically to the carrier when you create a

      details, shipping date,

      and other information that help them plan your package's delivery when you
      create a label.


      However, some providers, like USPS require manifests when shipping large
      numbers of packages. Think about how long it would take for a delivery
      driver to arrive, pick up 100 packages, and individually scan each of
      them.


      A manifest exists so the carrier can scan the manifest and check in all
      the packages being shipped.

      Shipments are the gatekeeper to more advanced functionality inside
      ShipEngine. When you create a shipment, we respond with a shipment_id that
      is a unique identifier inside of ShipEngine.

      Additionally, we realize that you may have your own identifier, you can
      set this by setting the `external_shipment_id` field in the request body.

        Data often enters your system as unstructured text (for example: emails,

        shipment-recognition API helps you extract meaningful, structured data

        same structure that's used for other ShipEngine APIs, so you can easily
        use the parsed data to create a shipping label.

        of the entity.  For example, if the substring "john doe" was recognized
        as a "person" entity, then the value might be normalized to have proper
        capitalization (e.g. "John Doe").  Or if the substring "ft worth" was
        recognized as a "city" entity, then the value might be normalized to
        "Fort Worth".


        Some entities have other information in addition to, or instead of a
        `value`.  For example, a "dimensions" entity will have separate fields
        for `length`, `width`, `height`, and `unit`.

        We recommend `pdf` format because it is supported by all carriers,
        whereas some carriers do not support the `png` or `zpl` formats.
