    ShipEngine is the world's best multi-carrier shipping API, with more than 20
    supported shipping carriers.  You can easily get and compare shipping rates,
    print labels, track your shipments, and validate addresses anywhere in the
    world.


    ### Worldwide Major Carrier Support

    Access the top global carriers in minutes—instead of weeks. Simply [connect
    your existing carrier
    accounts](https://docs.shipengine.com/docs/setup-a-carrier) in the API
    dashboard, and then [begin creating
    labels](https://docs.shipengine.com/docs/use-a-specific-service).


    ### Real-Time Tracking

    [Track packages](https://docs.shipengine.com/docs/track-a-package) across
    any of our 20+ supported carrier accounts and create tracking events to keep
    your customers up-to-date. Easily integrate real-time tracking information
    for shipments into your app, email, or SMS.


    ### Get Rates Across Carriers

    Make sure you ship as cost-effectively as possible by [quickly comparing
    rates](https://docs.shipengine.com/docs/get-shipping-rates) using the
    ShipEngine Rates API. As long as you have the carrier connected to your
    account, you'll be able to see and compare different rates and services.


    ### Global Address Validation

    No matter your shipping volume, failed deliveries and address change
    surcharges cut into your bottom line and damage perception with customers.
    Our address validation services ensure your packages make it to the right
    place the first time. [Learn how to leverage our address validation services
    here.](https://docs.shipengine.com/docs/address-validation)


    ShipEngine supports address validation for over 180 countries, including the
    United States, Canada, Great Britain, Australia, Germany, France, Norway,
    Spain, Sweden, Israel, Italy, and more.

      Data often enters your system as unstructured text (for example: emails,
      SMS messages, support tickets, or other documents). ShipEngine's
      address-recognition API helps you extract meaningful address data (e.g.
      recipient name, address line 1, line 2, city, postal code) from this
      unstructured text.

        The address-recognition API makes it easy for you to extract address
        data from unstructured text, including the recipient name, line 1, line
        2, city, postal code, and more.


        Data often enters your system as unstructured text (for example: emails,
        SMS messages, support tickets, or other documents). ShipEngine's
        address-recognition API helps you extract meaningful, structured data
        from this unstructured text. The parsed address data is returned in the
        same structure that's used for other ShipEngine APIs, such as address
        validation, rate quotes, and shipping labels.


        > **Note:** Address recognition is currently supported for the United
        States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Ireland.

          The only required field is `text`, which is the text to be parsed. You
          can optionally also provide an `address` containing already-known
          values. For example, you may already know the recipient's name, city,
          and country, and only want to parse the street address into separate
          lines.

      Batches are an advanced feature of ShipEngine designed for users who need
      to generate hundreds or thousands of labels at a time.

      When ShipEngine generates labels it relies on many carriers, their
      services, their dependencies, and a number of other variables

      to fulfill your requests; those requests can take a few minutes for us to
      get back to you.

      details, shipping date,

      and other information that help them plan your package's delivery when you
      create a label.


      However, some providers, like USPS require manifests when shipping large
      numbers of packages. Think about how long it would take for a delivery
      driver to arrive, pick up 100 packages, and individually scan each of
      them.


      A manifest exists so the carrier can scan the manifest and check in all
      the packages being shipped.

        The shipment-recognition API makes it easy for you to extract shipping
        data from unstructured text, including people's names, addresses,

        more.


        Data often enters your system as unstructured text (for example: emails,
        SMS messages, support tickets, or other documents). ShipEngine's
        shipment-recognition API helps you extract meaningful, structured data
        from this unstructured text. The parsed shipment data is returned in the
        same structure that's used for other ShipEngine APIs, so you can easily
        use the parsed data to create a shipping label.

        States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Ireland.

        capitalization (e.g. "John Doe").  Or if the substring "ft worth" was
        recognized as a "city" entity, then the value might be normalized to
        "Fort Worth".


        Some entities have other information in addition to, or instead of a
        `value`.  For example, a "dimensions" entity will have separate fields
        for `length`, `width`, `height`, and `unit`.

        The available layouts (sizes) in which shipping labels can be

        is only supported for `pdf` format.

        The possible file formats in which shipping labels can be downloaded. 
        We recommend `pdf` format because it is supported by all carriers,
        whereas some carriers do not support the `png` or `zpl` formats.
