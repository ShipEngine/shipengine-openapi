summary: List labels
description: |
  This endpoint returns a list of labels that you've [created](https://docs.shipengine.com/docs/quickstart-create-a-label). You can optionally filter the results as well as control their sort order and the number of results returned at a time.

  By default, all labels are returned, 25 at a time, starting with the most recently created ones.  You can combine multiple filter options to narrow-down the results.  For example, if you only want to get your UPS labels for your east coast warehouse you could query by both `warehouse_id` and `carrier_id`

  > **Warning:** Test labels (those created with `test_label: true`) are not included in the results.  If you've only ever created test labels, then the results will be empty.
