summary: Parse shipping info
description: |
  Data often enters your system as unstructured text (for example: emails, SMS messages, support tickets, or other documents). ShipEngine's shipment-recognition API helps you extract meaningful shipping data (people's names, addresses, package weights and dimensions, insurance and delivery requirements, etc.) from this unstructured text.
