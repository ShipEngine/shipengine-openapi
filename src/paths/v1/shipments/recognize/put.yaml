summary: Parse shipping info
description: |
  The shipment-recognition API makes it easy for you to extract shipping data from unstructured text, including people's names, addresses, package weights and dimensions, insurance and delivery requirements, and more.

  Data often enters your system as unstructured text (for example: emails, SMS messages, support tickets, or other documents). ShipEngine's shipment-recognition API helps you extract meaningful, structured data from this unstructured text. The parsed shipment data is returned in the same structure that's used for other ShipEngine APIs, so you can easily use the parsed data to create a shipping label.

  > **Note:** Shipment recognition is currently supported for the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Ireland.

    The only required field is `text`, which is the text to be parsed. You can optionally also provide a `shipment` containing any already-known values. For example, you probably already know the `ship_from` address, and you may also already know what carrier and service you want to use.

            This is the simplest way to call the shipment-recognition API. Just pass the text to be parsed and nothing else.

            You can optionally provide a `shipment` object containing any already-known values. For example, you probably already know the `ship_from` address, and you may also already know what carrier and service you want to use.
