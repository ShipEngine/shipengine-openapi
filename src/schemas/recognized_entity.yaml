      The result object is different for each entity type.

      Most entity results have a `value` field, which is the normalized value of the entity.  For example, if the substring "john doe" was recognized as a "person" entity, then the value might be normalized to have proper capitalization (e.g. "John Doe").  Or if the substring "ft worth" was recognized as a "city" entity, then the value might be normalized to "Fort Worth".

      Some entities have other information in addition to, or instead of a `value`.  For example, a "dimensions" entity will have separate fields for `length`, `width`, `height`, and `unit`.
