      The parsed shipment.  This shipment may not be complete, depending on how much information was included in the text and how confident the API is about each recognized entity.

      > **Note:** The shipment-recognition API does not currently perform any validation of the parsed addresses, so we recommend that you use the [address-validation API](https://docs.shipengine.com/docs/address-validation) to ensure that the addresses are correct.
