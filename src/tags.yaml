    [Webhooks](https://docs.shipengine.com/docs/setting-up-web-hooks) are a powerful feature of ShipEngine that can save you from sending repeated polling requests to check on the state of something.  With webhooks, ShipEngine will automatically contact your servers when the stage changes.  This can include [parcel tracking](https://docs.shipengine.com/docs/track-a-package) events, notification of the completion of a [batch operation](https://docs.shipengine.com/docs/using-batches),  or new [salses orders](https://docs.shipengine.com/docs/sales-orders-getting-started).
